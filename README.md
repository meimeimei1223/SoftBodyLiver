## Overview

SoftBodyLiver is a C++ project designed to simulate the physical behavior of soft tissues like the liver in an interactive manner. It can be applied to various fields such as medical training, surgical simulation, and educational purposes.

## Features

- Tetrahedral mesh-based deformation
- Stable simulation using Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD)
- **Neo-Hookean material model for realistic non-linear elasticity**
- Real-time interactive deformation
- Intuitive mouse-based interaction (grab and drag)
- Separation of visual mesh and physics simulation mesh
- 3D rendering with OpenGL
- **Dynamic switching between constraint types**
- **Adjustable material properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio)**

## Technologies

- C++17
- OpenGL / GLEW / GLFW
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
- CMake
- OpenCV (for parallelization)

## Mesh File Formats

The simulation requires two types of mesh files:

1. **Tetrahedral Mesh (.txt)**: Used for physics simulation
   - Format: Custom text file with sections for VERTICES, TETRAHEDRA, EDGES, and SURFACE_TRIANGLES
   - Path: `model/liver_tetrahedral_mesh.txt`
   - This mesh defines the volumetric structure used for physical simulation
   - Contains tetrahedral elements that make up the internal structure of the liver
   - Generated using a modified version of Matthias Mueller's tetrahedralization tool (see Acknowledgements)

2. **Surface Mesh (.obj)**: Used for visualization
   - Format: Standard Wavefront OBJ file format
   - Path: `model/liver.obj`
   - This mesh defines the visual representation of the liver
   - Contains only the surface geometry for rendering purposes

The system uses different meshes for simulation and visualization to balance performance and visual quality. The tetrahedral mesh provides accurate physical behavior, while the surface mesh offers detailed visual representation.

## Building

## Implementation Details

### Physics Simulation

- XPBD (Extended Position Based Dynamics) for stable soft body simulation
- Tetrahedral elements for volumetric deformation
- Edge constraints to maintain structural integrity
- Volume preservation constraints to simulate incompressible soft tissues
- **Neo-Hookean material model for physically accurate non-linear elasticity**
- **simplified inversion handling of inverted elements for robust simulation**
- Spatial hashing for efficient collision detection

### Neo-Hookean Material Model

The Neo-Hookean material model is a hyperelastic, non-linear constitutive model that accurately captures the behavior of soft tissues under large deformations:

- Uses Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio to define material properties
- Handles both small and large deformations appropriately
- Properly maintains volume under compression
- Robustly handles element inversion
- Based on continuum mechanics principles with physically accurate behavior

### Rendering System

- Vertex skinning to map the physical tetrahedral mesh to the visual surface mesh
- Dynamic normal calculation for realistic lighting
- Support for multiple visualization meshes with transparency
- Option to visualize the tetrahedral structure for debugging

### Performance Optimizations

- Spatial hashing for efficient neighbor finding
- Cached adjacency lists for mesh topology
- Optimized constraint solvers with multiple iterations for stability
- Smart detection and correction of abnormal deformations
